= Forward-Url

The goal of this app is simply to test the boundaries of the container in which it runs. Just start it with npm start and then open you browser at where the app is running.

You will find a simple text input-box which awaits a REST-URL. Triggering
the download of the REST-Data will be
handled by the backend. By that you can find out if you can reach the resources you need to reach for other applications. And if it does not work the app will show you the error, to help you identifiying and resolving the issue that might be there in your fire wall or proxy.
